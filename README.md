## Project Overview <a name="overview"><a/>
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. The ability to identify customer who are about to churn is essential for any business that want's to keep itself relevant. It is known that acquiring new customers is more expensive than keeping the ones you already have. With that in mind, the goal of this project is to help the fictional Sparkify music service to retain it's customers. In order to do that, I analyzed Sparkify's data and built a machine learning model to predict if a particular customer will abandon the service in the future and act upon it.
